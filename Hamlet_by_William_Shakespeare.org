  *About Shakespeare:*
  William Shakespeare (baptised 26 April 1564 -- died 23 April 1616) was
  an English poet and playwright, widely regarded as the greatest writer
  in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist. He is
  often called England's national poet and the "Bard of Avon" (or simply
  "The Bard"). His surviving works consist of 38 plays, 154 sonnets, two
  long narrative poems, and several other poems. His plays have been
  translated into every major living language, and are performed more
  often than those of any other playwright. Shakespeare was born and
  raised in Stratford-upon-Avon. At the age of 18 he married Anne
  Hathaway, who bore him three children: Susanna, and twins Hamnet and
  Judith. Between 1585 and 1592 he began a successful career in London as
  an actor, writer, and part owner of the playing company the Lord
  Chamberlain's Men, later known as the King's Men. He appears to have
  retired to Stratford around 1613, where he died three years later. Few
  records of Shakespeare's private life survive, and there has been
  considerable speculation about such matters as his sexuality, religious
  beliefs, and whether the works attributed to him were written by others.
  Shakespeare produced most of his known work between 1590 and 1613. His
  early plays were mainly comedies and histories, genres he raised to the
  peak of sophistication and artistry by the end of the sixteenth century.
  Next he wrote mainly tragedies until about 1608, including Hamlet, King
  Lear, and Macbeth, considered some of the finest examples in the English
  language. In his last phase, he wrote tragicomedies, also known as
  romances, and collaborated with other playwrights. Many of his plays
  were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy during his
  lifetime, and in 1623 two of his former theatrical colleagues published
  the First Folio, a collected edition of his dramatic works that included
  all but two of the plays now recognised as Shakespeare's. Shakespeare
  was a respected poet and playwright in his own day, but his reputation
  did not rise to its present heights until the nineteenth century. The
  Romantics, in particular, acclaimed Shakespeare's genius, and the
  Victorians hero-worshipped Shakespeare with a reverence that George
  Bernard Shaw called "bardolatry". In the twentieth century, his work was
  repeatedly adopted and rediscovered by new movements in scholarship and
  performance. His plays remain highly popular today and are consistently
  performed and reinterpreted in diverse cultural and political contexts
  throughout the world. Source: Wikipedia

   'Tis strange.

   *MARCELLUS*

   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,
   Why this same strict and most observant watch
   So nightly toils the subject of the land,
   And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,
   And foreign mart for implements of war;
   Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
   Does not divide the Sunday from the week;
   What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
   Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:
   Who is't that can inform me?
   #+END_QUOTE

   *HORATIO*

   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   That can I;
   At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
   Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
   Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
   Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
   Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet---
   For so this side of our known world esteem'd him---
   Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact,
   Well ratified by law and heraldry,
   Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
   Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:
   Against the which, a moiety competent
   Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
   To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
   Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,
   And carriage of the article design'd,
   His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
   Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
   Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there
   Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
   For food and diet, to some enterprise
   That hath a stomach in't; which is no other---
   As it doth well appear unto our state---
   But to recover of us, by strong hand
   And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
   So by his father lost: and this, I take it,
   Is the main motive of our preparations,
   The source of this our watch and the chief head
   Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
   #+END_QUOTE

   *BERNARDO*

   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   I think it be no other but e'en so:
   Well may it sort that this portentous figure
   Comes armed through our watch; so like the king
   That was and is the question of these wars.

   *HORATIO*

   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
   In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
   A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
   The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead
   Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:
   As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,
   Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
   Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
   Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:
   And even the like precurse of fierce events,
   As harbingers preceding still the fates
   And prologue to the omen coming on,
   Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
   Unto our climatures and countrymen.---
   But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!

   /Re-enter Ghost/

   I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!
   If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
   Speak to me:
   If there be any good thing to be done,
   That may to thee do ease and grace to me,
   Speak to me:

   /Cock crows/

   If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
   Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!
   Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
   Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,
   For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,
   Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.

   It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
   #+END_QUOTE

   *HORATIO*

   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   And then it started like a guilty thing
   Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,
   The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
   Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
   Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,
   Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
   The extravagant and erring spirit hies
   To his confine: and of the truth herein
   This present object made probation.
   #+END_QUOTE

   *MARCELLUS*

   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   It faded on the crowing of the cock.
   Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes
   Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
   The bird of dawning singeth all night long:
   And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;
   The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,
   No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
   So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
   #+END_QUOTE

   *HORATIO*

   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   So have I heard and do in part believe it.
   But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
   Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:
   Break we our watch up; and by my advice,
   Let us impart what we have seen to-night
   Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
   This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
   Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
   As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?

   #+END_QUOTE

   *KING CLAUDIUS*

   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
   The memory be green, and that it us befitted
   To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom
   To be contracted in one brow of woe,
   Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
   That we with wisest sorrow think on him,
   Together with remembrance of ourselves.
   Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
   The imperial jointress to this warlike state,
   Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,---
   With an auspicious and a dropping eye,
   With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,
   In equal scale weighing delight and dole,---
   Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr'd
   Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
   With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
   Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
   Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
   Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
   Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
   Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,
   He hath not fail'd to pester us with message,
   Importing the surrender of those lands
   Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,
   To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
   Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:
   Thus much the business is: we have here writ
   To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,---
   Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears
   Of this his nephew's purpose,---to suppress
   His further gait herein; in that the levies,
   The lists and full proportions, are all made
   Out of his subject: and we here dispatch
   You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,
   For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;
   Giving to you no further personal power
   To business with the king, more than the scope
   Of these delated articles allow.
   Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.

   /Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS/

   And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
   You told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes?
   You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,
   And loose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
   That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
   The head is not more native to the heart,
   The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
   Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
   What wouldst thou have, Laertes?

   Seems, madam! nay it is; I know not 'seems.'
   'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,

   No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
   Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage,
   Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
   That can denote me truly: these indeed seem,
   For they are actions that a man might play:
   But I have that within which passeth show;
   These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
   #+END_QUOTE

   *KING CLAUDIUS*

   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
   To give these mourning duties to your father:
   But, you must know, your father lost a father;
   That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
   In filial obligation for some term
   To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever
   In obstinate condolement is a course
   Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief;
   It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
   A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
   An understanding simple and unschool'd:
   For what we know must be and is as common
   As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
   Why should we in our peevish opposition
   Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
   A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
   To reason most absurd: whose common theme
   Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
   From the first corse till he that died to-day,
   'This must be so.' We pray you, throw to earth
   This unprevailing woe, and think of us
   As of a father: for let the world take note,
   You are the most immediate to our throne;
   And with no less nobility of love
   Than that which dearest father bears his son,
   Do I impart toward you. For your intent
   In going back to school in Wittenberg,
   It is most retrograde to our desire:
   And we beseech you, bend you to remain
   Here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
   Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.

   Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply:
   Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;
   This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet
   Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,
   No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day,
   But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
   And the king's rouse the heavens all bruit again,
   Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.

   O, that this too too solid flesh would melt
   Thaw and resolve itself into a dew!
   Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
   His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
   How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable,
   Seem to me all the uses of this world!
   Fie on't! ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,
   That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
   Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
   But two months dead: nay, not so much, not two:
   So excellent a king; that was, to this,
   Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
   That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
   Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
   Must I remember? why, she would hang on him,
   As if increase of appetite had grown
   By what it fed on: and yet, within a month---
   Let me not think on't---Frailty, thy name is woman!---
   A little month, or ere those shoes were old
   With which she follow'd my poor father's body,
   Like Niobe, all tears:---why she, even she---
   O, God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason,
   Would have mourn'd longer---married with my uncle,
   My father's brother, but no more like my father
   Than I to Hercules: within a month:
   Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
   Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
   She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
   With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
   It is not nor it cannot come to good:
   But break, my heart; for I must hold my tongue.

   Two nights together had these gentlemen,
   Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch,
   In the dead vast and middle of the night,
   Been thus encounter'd. A figure like your father,
   Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
   Appears before them, and with solemn march
   Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'd
   By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
   Within his truncheon's length; whilst they, distilled
   Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
   Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
   In dreadful secrecy impart they did;
   And I with them the third night kept the watch;
   Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
   Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
   The apparition comes: I knew your father;
   These hands are not more like.

   For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour,

   Think it no more;
   For nature, crescent, does not grow alone
   In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,
   The inward service of the mind and soul
   Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,
   And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
   The virtue of his will: but you must fear,
   His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
   For he himself is subject to his birth:
   He may not, as unvalued persons do,
   Carve for himself; for on his choice depends
   The safety and health of this whole state;
   And therefore must his choice be circumscribed
   Unto the voice and yielding of that body
   Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
   It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
   As he in his particular act and place
   May give his saying deed; which is no further
   Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
   Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,
   If with too credent ear you list his songs,
   Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
   To his unmaster'd importunity.
   Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
   And keep you in the rear of your affection,
   Out of the shot and danger of desire.
   The chariest maid is prodigal enough,
   If she unmask her beauty to the moon:
   Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes:
   The canker galls the infants of the spring,
   Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,
   And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
   Contagious blastments are most imminent.
   Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:
   Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.

   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!
   The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
   And you are stay'd for. There; my blessing with thee!
   And these few precepts in thy memory
   See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
   Nor any unproportioned thought his act.
   Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.
   Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
   Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;
   But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
   Of each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade. Beware
   Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,
   Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.
   Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;
   Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
   Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
   But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
   For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
   And they in France of the best rank and station
   Are of a most select and generous chief in that.
   Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
   For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
   And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
   This above all: to thine ownself be true,
   And it must follow, as the night the day,
   Thou canst not then be false to any man.
   Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!

   Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,

   Giving more light than heat, extinct in both,
   Even in their promise, as it is a-making,
   You must not take for fire. From this time
   Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence;
   Set your entreatments at a higher rate
   Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
   Believe so much in him, that he is young
   And with a larger tether may he walk
   Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia,
   Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,
   Not of that dye which their investments show,
   But mere implorators of unholy suits,
   Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
   The better to beguile. This is for all:
   I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth,

   They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase
   Soil our addition; and indeed it takes
   From our achievements, though perform'd at height,
   The pith and marrow of our attribute.
   So, oft it chances in particular men,
   That for some vicious mole of nature in them,
   As, in their birth---wherein they are not guilty,
   Since nature cannot choose his origin---
   By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
   Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,
   Or by some habit that too much o'er-leavens
   The form of plausive manners, that these men,
   Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
   Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,---
   Their virtues else---be they as pure as grace,
   As infinite as man may undergo---

   And for the day confined to fast in fires,
   Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
   Are burnt and purged away. But that I am forbid
   To tell the secrets of my prison-house,
   I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
   Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
   Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
   Thy knotted and combined locks to part
   And each particular hair to stand on end,
   Like quills upon the fretful porpentine:
   But this eternal blazon must not be
   To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!
   If thou didst ever thy dear father love---

   'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
   A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark
   Is by a forged process of my death
   Rankly abused: but know, thou noble youth,
   The serpent that did sting thy father's life
   Now wears his crown.

   Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
   With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,---
   O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
   So to seduce!---won to his shameful lust
   The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen:
   O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there!
   From me, whose love was of that dignity
   That it went hand in hand even with the vow
   I made to her in marriage, and to decline
   Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
   To those of mine!
   But virtue, as it never will be moved,
   Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
   So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
   Will sate itself in a celestial bed,
   And prey on garbage.
   But, soft! methinks I scent the morning air;
   Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
   My custom always of the afternoon,
   Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
   With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,
   And in the porches of my ears did pour
   The leperous distilment; whose effect
   Holds such an enmity with blood of man
   That swift as quicksilver it courses through
   The natural gates and alleys of the body,
   And with a sudden vigour doth posset
   And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
   The thin and wholesome blood: so did it mine;
   And a most instant tetter bark'd about,
   Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust,
   All my smooth body.
   Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
   Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd:
   Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
   Unhousel'd, disappointed, unanel'd,
   No reckoning made, but sent to my account
   With all my imperfections on my head:
   O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
   If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;
   Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
   A couch for luxury and damned incest.
   But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,
   Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
   Against thy mother aught: leave her to heaven
   And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,
   To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!
   The glow-worm shows the matin to be near,
   And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire:
   Adieu, adieu! Hamlet, remember me.

   Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
   In this distracted globe. Remember thee!
   Yea, from the table of my memory
   I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
   All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,

   Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
   The youth you breathe of guilty, be assured

   At last, a little shaking of mine arm

   He raised a sigh so piteous and profound
   As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
   And end his being: that done, he lets me go:

   More grief to hide than hate to utter love.

   /Re-enter POLONIUS, with VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS/

   Welcome, my good friends!
   Say, Voltimand, what from our brother Norway?
   #+END_QUOTE

   *VOLTIMAND*

   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   Most fair return of greetings and desires.
   Upon our first, he sent out to suppress
   His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd
   To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack;
   But, better look'd into, he truly found
   It was against your highness: whereat grieved,
   That so his sickness, age and impotence
   Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests
   On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys;
   Receives rebuke from Norway, and in fine
   Makes vow before his uncle never more
   To give the assay of arms against your majesty.
   Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,
   Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee,
   And his commission to employ those soldiers,
   So levied as before, against the Polack:
   With an entreaty, herein further shown,

   /Giving a paper/

   That it might please you to give quiet pass
   Through your dominions for this enterprise,
   On such regards of safety and allowance
   As therein are set down.
   #+END_QUOTE

   *KING CLAUDIUS*

   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   It likes us well;
   And at our more consider'd time well read,
   Answer, and think upon this business.
   Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour:
   Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together:
   Most welcome home!

   This business is well ended.
   My liege, and madam, to expostulate
   What majesty should be, what duty is,
   Why day is day, night night, and time is time,
   Were nothing but to waste night, day and time.
   Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,
   And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
   I will be brief: your noble son is mad:
   Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,
   What is't but to be nothing else but mad?
   But let that go.

   Madam, I swear I use no art at all.
   That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
   And pity 'tis 'tis true: a foolish figure;
   But farewell it, for I will use no art.
   Mad let us grant him, then: and now remains
   That we find out the cause of this effect,
   Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
   For this effect defective comes by cause:
   Thus it remains, and the remainder thus. Perpend.
   I have a daughter---have while she is mine---
   Who, in her duty and obedience, mark,
   Hath given me this: now gather, and surmise.

   /Reads/

   'To the celestial and my soul's idol, the most
   beautified Ophelia,'---
   That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is

   'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers;
   I have not art to reckon my groans: but that
   I love thee best, O most best, believe it. Adieu.
   'Thine evermore most dear lady, whilst
   this machine is to him, HAMLET.'
   This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me,
   And more above, hath his solicitings,
   As they fell out by time, by means and place,
   All given to mine ear.

   I would fain prove so. But what might you think,
   When I had seen this hot love on the wing---
   As I perceived it, I must tell you that,
   Before my daughter told me---what might you,
   Or my dear majesty your queen here, think,
   If I had play'd the desk or table-book,
   Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,
   Or look'd upon this love with idle sight;
   What might you think? No, I went round to work,
   And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
   'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star;
   This must not be:' and then I precepts gave her,
   That she should lock herself from his resort,
   Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.
   Which done, she took the fruits of my advice;
   And he, repulsed---a short tale to make---
   Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,
   Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,
   Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,
   Into the madness wherein now he raves,
   And all we mourn for.

   excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave
   o'erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted
   with golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to
   me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours.
   What a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason!
   how infinite in faculty! in form and moving how
   express and admirable! in action how like an angel!
   in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the

   You are welcome, masters; welcome, all. I am glad
   to see thee well. Welcome, good friends. O, my old
   friend! thy face is valenced since I saw thee last:
   comest thou to beard me in Denmark? What, my young
   lady and mistress! By'r lady, your ladyship is
   nearer to heaven than when I saw you last, by the
   altitude of a chopine. Pray God, your voice, like
   apiece of uncurrent gold, be not cracked within the

   I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was
   never acted; or, if it was, not above once; for the
   play, I remember, pleased not the million; 'twas
   caviare to the general: but it was---as I received
   it, and others, whose judgments in such matters
   cried in the top of mine---an excellent play, well
   digested in the scenes, set down with as much
   modesty as cunning. I remember, one said there
   were no sallets in the lines to make the matter
   savoury, nor no matter in the phrase that might
   indict the author of affectation; but called it an
   honest method, as wholesome as sweet, and by very
   much more handsome than fine. One speech in it I
   chiefly loved: 'twas Aeneas' tale to Dido; and
   thereabout of it especially, where he speaks of
   Priam's slaughter: if it live in your memory, begin
   at this line: let me see, let me see---
   'The rugged Pyrrhus, like the Hyrcanian beast,'---
   it is not so:---it begins with Pyrrhus:---
   'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,
   Black as his purpose, did the night resemble
   When he lay couched in the ominous horse,
   Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd
   With heraldry more dismal; head to foot
   Now is he total gules; horridly trick'd
   With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
   Baked and impasted with the parching streets,
   That lend a tyrannous and damned light
   To their lord's murder: roasted in wrath and fire,
   And thus o'er-sized with coagulate gore,
   With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
   Old grandsire Priam seeks.'
   So, proceed you.

   'Anon he finds him
   Striking too short at Greeks; his antique sword,
   Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,
   Repugnant to command: unequal match'd,
   Pyrrhus at Priam drives; in rage strikes wide;
   But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword
   The unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,
   Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top
   Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash
   Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear: for, lo! his sword,
   Which was declining on the milky head
   Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' the air to stick:
   So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,
   And like a neutral to his will and matter,
   Did nothing.
   But, as we often see, against some storm,
   A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,
   The bold winds speechless and the orb below
   As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder
   Doth rend the region, so, after Pyrrhus' pause,
   Aroused vengeance sets him new a-work;
   And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall
   On Mars's armour forged for proof eterne
   With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword
   Now falls on Priam.
   Out, out, thou strumpet, Fortune! All you gods,

   Now I am alone.
   O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!
   Is it not monstrous that this player here,
   But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
   Could force his soul so to his own conceit
   That from her working all his visage wann'd,
   Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,
   A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
   With forms to his conceit? and all for nothing!
   For Hecuba!
   What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
   That he should weep for her? What would he do,
   Had he the motive and the cue for passion
   That I have? He would drown the stage with tears
   And cleave the general ear with horrid speech,
   Make mad the guilty and appal the free,
   Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed
   The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I,
   A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak,
   Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,
   And can say nothing; no, not for a king,
   Upon whose property and most dear life
   A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?
   Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?
   Plucks off my beard, and blows it in my face?
   Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i' the throat,
   As deep as to the lungs? who does me this?
   Ha!
   'Swounds, I should take it: for it cannot be
   But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall
   To make oppression bitter, or ere this
   I should have fatted all the region kites
   With this slave's offal: bloody, bawdy villain!
   Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!
   O, vengeance!
   Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,
   That I, the son of a dear father murder'd,
   Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,
   Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words,
   And fall a-cursing, like a very drab,
   A scullion!
   Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! I have heard
   That guilty creatures sitting at a play
   Have by the very cunning of the scene
   Been struck so to the soul that presently
   They have proclaim'd their malefactions;
   For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak
   With most miraculous organ. I'll have these players
   Play something like the murder of my father
   Before mine uncle: I'll observe his looks;
   I'll tent him to the quick: if he but blench,
   I know my course. The spirit that I have seen
   May be the devil: and the devil hath power
   To assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps
   Out of my weakness and my melancholy,
   As he is very potent with such spirits,
   Abuses me to damn me: I'll have grounds
   More relative than this: the play 's the thing
   Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.

   To be, or not to be: that is the question:
   Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
   The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
   Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
   And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;
   No more; and by a sleep to say we end
   The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
   That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation
   Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;
   To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;
   For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
   When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
   Must give us pause: there's the respect
   That makes calamity of so long life;
   For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
   The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
   The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,
   The insolence of office and the spurns
   That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
   When he himself might his quietus make
   With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,
   To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
   But that the dread of something after death,
   The undiscover'd country from whose bourn
   No traveller returns, puzzles the will
   And makes us rather bear those ills we have
   Than fly to others that we know not of?
   Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
   And thus the native hue of resolution
   Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
   And enterprises of great pith and moment
   With this regard their currents turn awry,
   And lose the name of action.---Soft you now!
   The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons

   Sprung from neglected love. How now, Ophelia!
   You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said;
   We heard it all. My lord, do as you please;
   But, if you hold it fit, after the play
   Let his queen mother all alone entreat him
   To show his grief: let her be round with him;
   And I'll be placed, so please you, in the ear

   Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to
   you, trippingly on the tongue: but if you mouth it,
   as many of your players do, I had as lief the
   town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air
   too much with your hand, thus, but use all gently;
   for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say,
   the whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget
   a temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it
   offends me to the soul to hear a robustious
   periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to
   very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who
   for the most part are capable of nothing but
   inexplicable dumbshows and noise: I would have such
   a fellow whipped for o'erdoing Termagant; it
   out-herods Herod: pray you, avoid it.

   Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion
   be your tutor: suit the action to the word, the
   word to the action; with this special o'erstep not
   the modesty of nature: for any thing so overdone is
   from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the
   first and now, was and is, to hold, as 'twere, the
   mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature,
   scorn her own image, and the very age and body of
   the time his form and pressure. Now this overdone,
   or come tardy off, though it make the unskilful
   laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; the
   censure of the which one must in your allowance
   o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be
   players that I have seen play, and heard others
   praise, and that highly, not to speak it profanely,
   that, neither having the accent of Christians nor
   the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so
   strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of
   nature's journeymen had made men and not made them
   well, they imitated humanity so abominably.

   set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh
   too; though, in the mean time, some necessary
   question of the play be then to be considered:
   that's villanous, and shows a most pitiful ambition
   in the fool that uses it. Go, make you ready.

   Nay, do not think I flatter;
   For what advancement may I hope from thee
   That no revenue hast but thy good spirits,
   To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?
   No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,
   And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
   Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?
   Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice
   And could of men distinguish, her election
   Hath seal'd thee for herself; for thou hast been
   As one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing,
   A man that fortune's buffets and rewards
   Hast ta'en with equal thanks: and blest are those
   Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled,
   That they are not a pipe for fortune's finger
   To sound what stop she please. Give me that man
   That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him
   In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,
   As I do thee.---Something too much of this.---
   There is a play to-night before the king;
   One scene of it comes near the circumstance
   Which I have told thee of my father's death:
   I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
   Even with the very comment of thy soul
   Observe mine uncle: if his occulted guilt
   Do not itself unkennel in one speech,
   It is a damned ghost that we have seen,
   And my imaginations are as foul
   As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;
   For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,
   And after we will both our judgments join
   In censure of his seeming.

   I do believe you think what now you speak;
   But what we do determine oft we break.
   Purpose is but the slave to memory,
   Of violent birth, but poor validity;
   Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree;
   But fall, unshaken, when they mellow be.
   Most necessary 'tis that we forget
   To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt:
   What to ourselves in passion we propose,
   The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
   The violence of either grief or joy
   Their own enactures with themselves destroy:
   Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;
   Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.
   This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange
   That even our loves should with our fortunes change;
   For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,
   Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.
   The great man down, you mark his favourite flies;
   The poor advanced makes friends of enemies.
   And hitherto doth love on fortune tend;
   For who not needs shall never lack a friend,
   And who in want a hollow friend doth try,
   Directly seasons him his enemy.
   But, orderly to end where I begun,
   Our wills and fates do so contrary run
   That our devices still are overthrown;
   Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own:
   So think thou wilt no second husband wed;
   But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.

   /Exit POLONIUS/

   O, my offence is rank it smells to heaven;
   It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,
   A brother's murder. Pray can I not,
   Though inclination be as sharp as will:
   My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent;
   And, like a man to double business bound,
   I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
   And both neglect. What if this cursed hand
   Were thicker than itself with brother's blood,
   Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens
   To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy
   But to confront the visage of offence?
   And what's in prayer but this two-fold force,
   To be forestalled ere we come to fall,
   Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;
   My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer
   Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murder'?
   That cannot be; since I am still possess'd
   Of those effects for which I did the murder,
   My crown, mine own ambition and my queen.
   May one be pardon'd and retain the offence?
   In the corrupted currents of this world
   Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,
   And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself
   Buys out the law: but 'tis not so above;
   There is no shuffling, there the action lies
   In his true nature; and we ourselves compell'd,
   Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,
   To give in evidence. What then? what rests?
   Try what repentance can: what can it not?
   Yet what can it when one can not repent?
   O wretched state! O bosom black as death!
   O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,
   Art more engaged! Help, angels! Make assay!
   Bow, stubborn knees; and, heart with strings of steel,
   Be soft as sinews of the newborn babe!
   All may be well.

   O, this is hire and salary, not revenge.

   With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;
   And how his audit stands who knows save heaven?
   But in our circumstance and course of thought,
   'Tis heavy with him: and am I then revenged,
   To take him in the purging of his soul,
   When he is fit and season'd for his passage?
   No!
   Up, sword; and know thou a more horrid hent:
   When he is drunk asleep, or in his rage,
   Or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed;
   At gaming, swearing, or about some act

   Look here, upon this picture, and on this,
   The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
   See, what a grace was seated on this brow;
   Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;
   An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;
   A station like the herald Mercury
   New-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill;
   A combination and a form indeed,
   Where every god did seem to set his seal,
   To give the world assurance of a man:
   This was your husband. Look you now, what follows:
   Here is your husband; like a mildew'd ear,
   Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?
   Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
   And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes?
   You cannot call it love; for at your age
   The hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble,
   And waits upon the judgment: and what judgment
   Would step from this to this? Sense, sure, you have,
   Else could you not have motion; but sure, that sense
   Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err,
   Nor sense to ecstasy was ne'er so thrall'd
   But it reserved some quantity of choice,
   To serve in such a difference. What devil was't
   That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?
   Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
   Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
   Or but a sickly part of one true sense
   Could not so mope.
   O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
   If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,
   To flaming youth let virtue be as wax,
   And melt in her own fire: proclaim no shame
   When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,
   Since frost itself as actively doth burn
   And reason panders will.

   For 'tis the sport to have the engineer
   Hoist with his own petard: and 't shall go hard
   But I will delve one yard below their mines,
   And blow them at the moon: O, 'tis most sweet,
   When in one line two crafts directly meet.
   This man shall set me packing:
   I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.
   Mother, good night. Indeed this counsellor
   Is now most still, most secret and most grave,
   Who was in life a foolish prating knave.
   Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.
   Good night, mother.

   How all occasions do inform against me,
   And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,
   If his chief good and market of his time
   Be but to sleep and feed? a beast, no more.
   Sure, he that made us with such large discourse,
   Looking before and after, gave us not
   That capability and god-like reason
   To fust in us unused. Now, whether it be
   Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple
   Of thinking too precisely on the event,
   A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom
   And ever three parts coward, I do not know
   Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do;'
   Sith I have cause and will and strength and means
   To do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me:
   Witness this army of such mass and charge
   Led by a delicate and tender prince,
   Whose spirit with divine ambition puff'd
   Makes mouths at the invisible event,
   Exposing what is mortal and unsure
   To all that fortune, death and danger dare,
   Even for an egg-shell. Rightly to be great
   Is not to stir without great argument,
   But greatly to find quarrel in a straw
   When honour's at the stake. How stand I then,
   That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,
   Excitements of my reason and my blood,
   And let all sleep? while, to my shame, I see
   The imminent death of twenty thousand men,
   That, for a fantasy and trick of fame,
   Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot
   Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,
   Which is not tomb enough and continent
   To hide the slain? O, from this time forth,
   My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!

   Next, your son gone; and he most violent author
   Of his own just remove: the people muddied,
   Thick and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers,
   For good Polonius' death; and we have done but greenly,
   In hugger-mugger to inter him: poor Ophelia
   Divided from herself and her fair judgment,
   Without the which we are pictures, or mere beasts:
   Last, and as much containing as all these,
   Her brother is in secret come from France;
   Feeds on his wonder, keeps himself in clouds,
   And wants not buzzers to infect his ear
   With pestilent speeches of his father's death;
   Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,
   Will nothing stick our person to arraign

   That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,

   Why to a public count I might not go,
   Is the great love the general gender bear him;
   Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,
   Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,
   Convert his gyves to graces; so that my arrows,
   Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,

   verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of
   great article; and his infusion of such dearth and

   Who does it, then? His madness: if't be so,

   The sight is dismal;
   And our affairs from England come too late:
   The ears are senseless that should give us hearing,
   To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd,
   That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead:
   Where should we have our thanks?

   Not from his mouth,
   Had it the ability of life to thank you:
   He never gave commandment for their death.
   But since, so jump upon this bloody question,
   You from the Polack wars, and you from England,
   Are here arrived give order that these bodies
   High on a stage be placed to the view;
   And let me speak to the yet unknowing world
   How these things came about: so shall you hear
   Of carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts,
   Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters,
   Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause,
   And, in this upshot, purposes mistook
   Fall'n on the inventors' reads: all this can I
   Truly deliver.

   Let us haste to hear it,
   And call the noblest to the audience.
   For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune:
   I have some rights of memory in this kingdom,
   Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me.

   Of that I shall have also cause to speak,
   And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more;
   But let this same be presently perform'd,
   Even while men's minds are wild; lest more mischance
   On plots and errors, happen.

   Let four captains
   Bear Hamlet, like a soldier, to the stage;
   For he was likely, had he been put on,
   To have proved most royally: and, for his passage,
   The soldiers' music and the rites of war
   Speak loudly for him.
   Take up the bodies: such a sight as this
   Becomes the field, but here shows much amiss.
   Go, bid the soldiers shoot.

   /A dead march. Exeunt, bearing off the dead bodies; after which a peal
   of ordnance is shot off/
